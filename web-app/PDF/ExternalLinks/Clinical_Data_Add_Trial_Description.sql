,'The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CNTO 95 when administered in combination with docetaxel in subjects with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of CNTO 95 administered in combination with docetaxel in the treatment of subjects with metastatic HRPC. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of docetaxel alone and in combination with CNTO 95 will also be evaluated as a secondary objective.'
