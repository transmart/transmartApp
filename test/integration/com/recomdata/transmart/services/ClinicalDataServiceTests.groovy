     * Study : Breast_Cancer_Sorlie_GSE4382
     * Workflow : Scatter Plot
     * Independent Variable : \Sample Factors\End Points\Recurrence-Free Survival Time
     * Dependent Variable : \Sample Factors\End Points\Survival Time (Months)
     *
     * After the test was done running I extracted the required parameters from the jobInfo.txt file that is created in the jobs temporary directory.
