# This script will read json-encoded auditlog messages from Transmart and send them as HTTP POST messages to
# an URL. The input must be provided as json objects separated by newlines. The json objects themselves must not
# contain unencoded newlines.
#
# This script will make up to THREADS requests in parallel to the metrics server. If a request fails this is noted
# on stderr, but the request is not retried so in that case the message is lost.
